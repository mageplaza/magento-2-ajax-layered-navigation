Product filtering is one of the most used features which every customer craves on your online store. To clarify, product filtering is an application that buyers select one or multiple product attributes to search for specific products which match their needs.

On an online store which there is no existence of shopping assistants, customers need nothing but an effective product filtering/searching tool.
